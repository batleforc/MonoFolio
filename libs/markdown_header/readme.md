# Markdown Header

This is a simple library to parse markdown headers and return a dictionary with the header information.

It's a fork from <https://docs.rs/crate/markdown-parser/latest> but I had to rewrite some parts of the code to make it more up to date.

## What ive changed ?

- Upgrade ALL dependencies
- Remove dependencies that are not needed
- Remove some code that was not needed in my case (the fs part)
- Write some tests

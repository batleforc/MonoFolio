## MariaDB

MariaDB is a SQL database, it was a fork of MySQL. Well with enough new feature and evolution over time we can say that it's now a different database with layer of compatbiility with MySQL.

I've used MariaDB for a long time, it's a pretty good database, it's easy to use and to maintain. It's a good database for small to medium project, for big project i would recommend to use PostgreSQL.

## Eclipse Che

Eclipse Che is a Cloud IDE, based on DevFile it's a kubernetes native environment.

This solution is the one i use when i need an IDE on the go and even on my own laptop. It's a good solution to have a full IDE in the cloud and to be able to work on your projects from anywhere.

I even use it sometime to administer my cluster.

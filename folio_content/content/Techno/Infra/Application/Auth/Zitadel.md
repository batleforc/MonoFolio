## Zitadel

Zitadel is an Identity and Access Management solution. Written in Go, it's a good self-hosted solution to manage your users and their access to your applications.

This solution is the one i use when i need to manage my users and their access to my applications. It's a good solution to have a full IAM in the cloud and to be able to manage your users from anywhere.

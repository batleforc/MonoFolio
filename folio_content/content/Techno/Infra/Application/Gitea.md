## Gitea

Gitea is a self-hosted Git service. It's a lightweight solution to host your own Git repositories. It's a good alternative to Gitlab or Github. It's written in Go and it's pretty easy to setup. It's a good solution if you want to have your own Git service and don't want to rely on a third party service.

I use Gitea to host my own repositories. It's a good solution to have a private repository and to have a good overview of your projects. It's a good solution to have a backup of your repositories and to have a good overview of your projects.

## Terraform

Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool. Written in Go, it's a good solution to manage your infrastructure as code. It's pretty easy to use and extend if needed.

I use Terraform to extend my GitOps solution. It's a good solution to manage your infrastructure as code and to be able to deploy your infrastructure.

## Ansiible

Ansible is an automation tool that allows you to automate the configuration of your servers. It's based on Yaml files that you can put in your repository. It's a pretty simple way to setup configuration like installing packages, configuring services, etc.

An ansible configuration is split between Tasks, Playbooks, Roles, etc. It's a must have tool in the belt in order to automate the setup of your environment. It's my favorite tool to automate the first setup and keep up to date the configuration of my servers.

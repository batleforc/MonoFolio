## JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level programming language that is used for web development. JavaScript is a dynamically typed where most thing are object and are interpreted.

I've learned JavaScript in school, no bad story but using bland JavaScript (without TypeScript) is a bit hard for me. I've learned to use JavaScript with TypeScript and it's a lot better. I've used JavaScript for a lot of project, and i'm still using it today.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

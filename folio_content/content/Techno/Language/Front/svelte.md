## Svelte

Svelte is a JavaScript framework that is used for web development. Svelte is a progressive framework that is used to build user interfaces and single-page applications. I've learned the basics of Svelte, and I'm waiting for the opportunity to use it in a project.

```svelte
<script>
  let name = 'world';
</script>

<h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
```

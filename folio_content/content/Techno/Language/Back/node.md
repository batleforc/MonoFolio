## Node.js

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is meant to be used for server-side applications. Yes, you can foolishly use it has is without TypeScript, but for your sanity, please never do that, your familly loves you. Node.js is very powerful and has a lot of libraries that you can use to build your applications. It is not has fast has Rust or Golang, but it is very easy to learn and to use.

```typescript
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

## Python

Python is a high-level programming language that is focused on readability and simplicity. It is a dynamically typed, interpreted language that is focused on code readability and simplicity. Python is a general-purpose language that is used for web development, data science, machine learning, and more.

I will not lie, Python is very powerfull and used in a lot of domain. BUT, i'm not a big fan of it, i don't know why, but i'm not. I've learned it in school, the teacher was very good, i learned a lot of concept with it. But again, i can't bring myself to like it and enjoy working with it.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

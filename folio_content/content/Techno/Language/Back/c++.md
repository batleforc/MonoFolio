## C++

C++ is a programming language that is used to build system software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, high-performance server, and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games. C++ is a statically typed, compiled language that is focused on performance and efficiency. C++ is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

I've learned C++ in school, i'm not too found of it, but it's a very powerful language that you can use to build a lot of things.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

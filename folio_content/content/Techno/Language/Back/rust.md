## Rust

Rust is a systems programming language, that is focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. In order to be safe, Rust doesn't have a garbage collector and thus doesn't have memory leaks. It enter in the compiled languages category, and it's syntax is similar to C++. Yes, Rust is pretty hard to learn at first, but once you get the hang of it, you will see that it is a very powerful language that you have close to no need to debug your code.

Rust is at the moment (2024) my main and favorite language to work with, and i have to say that i'm very happy with it.

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

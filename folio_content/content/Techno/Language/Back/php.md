## PHP

PHP is a server-side scripting language that is used mostly for web development. Php is an interpreted language.

I've learned PHP in school, and even if it wasn't a good memory (less than the "java doc"), i pretty much like using it. It's a very powerfull language that has a lot of library and framework that you can use to build a lot of things.

```php
<?php
echo "Hello, world!";
?>
```

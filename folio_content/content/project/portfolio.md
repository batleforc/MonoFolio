This project is a portfolio that will be used to showcase my work and my skills. It will be a mix of a blog, a documentation and a project showcase.

## Idea

The idea is to rewrite the portfolio from scratch but keeping the idea behind the layout. The responsive will be reworked and the content will be improved and completed.

### Home

The page will maintain a presentation of myself and a basic history. The CV will follow and a minimal project section will be added. To finish, a contact and social section will be added.

### Blog / Doc / Project

This part of the project is a big chunk of the work. There will be tree display of the content. The blog who will be used to share in a timeline the discovery, the tutorial and the project that I've done. The project section will be used to showcase the project that I've done, the project that I'm working on and the future project that I'm thinking about they will be displayed in a more search tag/project maner. The doc section will be used to share everythings that I've learned and that I'm learning. It will include the content of the previous one.

### Easter Egg

Well, the *easter egg* part of the project will more or less be an excuse to have a sandbox to play with. The idea is to not lock myself in a single idea and will be split between a possible 3D project, some vanilla js content and some other idea that I will have or already have.

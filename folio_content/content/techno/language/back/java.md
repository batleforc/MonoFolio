## Java

Java is a high-level programming language that is statically typed, compiled language that is run by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is a general-purpose language that is used for web development, mobile development, and more.

I've learned Java in school, and ended up having shivers down my spine when i hear the word `JAVA DOC`. But i have to say, it's a very powerfull language that you can use to build a lot of things. And yes, i pretty much like using it.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

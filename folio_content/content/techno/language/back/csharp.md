## C# or C Sharp

C# is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a statically typed, compiled language that is focused on simplicity and efficiency. C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.

This language is also one of those that i learned in school, and i have to say that if i ever have to choose between `THE JAVA DOC` and C#... my choise is already made.

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

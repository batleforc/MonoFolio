## Golang

Golang is a programming language developed by Google. It is a statically typed, compiled language that is focused on simplicity and efficiency. With time you learn that there is close to no quick function build it, but once your learned that, you discover that the language is fast enought and easy to learn that you wouldn't go back.

This language was my previous year (2023) main language to work with and discovery. And i have to say, it's a very good language to work with even more in the cloud world.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
```

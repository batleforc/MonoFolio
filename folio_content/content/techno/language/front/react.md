## React.js

React.js is a JavaScript framework that is used for web development. React.js is a progressive framework that is used to build user interfaces and single-page applications.

I've learned React.js in school, and I've used it for a lot of projects. I learned a lot about front-end development with React.js, and had a lot of headaches with React-Redux. I still like using React.js, but i'm more into Vue.js.

```react
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

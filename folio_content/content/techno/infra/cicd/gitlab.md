## Gitlab CI/CD

Gitlab CI/CD is the CI/CD system of Gitlab. It allows you to run multiple kind of pipelines on your code. It's based on Yaml files that you can put in your repository. It's not my favorite CI/CD tool but it's a pretty good one. Like Tekton, it's a pretty good tool to start with CI/CD, it has a lot of features and an approach to the CI/CD that is pretty simple to understand.

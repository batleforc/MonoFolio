## K3s

K3s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, it's meant to be used on edge devices or small environments like MonoNode. It's written in Go and is pretty simple to setup. It's a good way to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running in a few minutes.

K3s is one of the upgrade that my environment has undergo. It's great configuration and simplicity made me switch from MicroK8S to K3s. It's the perfect tool for home labs.
